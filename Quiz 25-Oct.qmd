## Quiz {.smaller}

1. Create an environment `x`. Within `x` create a second environment `y`. In `y` bind a variable named `z` and give it a value of "hi". Create a function that exists in `y`. This function should do 2 things: 1) read the value of `z` in `y` and 2) uses super assignment to bind a variable named `w` in `x` that takes the current value of `z`.

2. What is a recursive function? Write a short example of a recursive function. 

3. What 2 commands did we discuss to show the "call stack"? Create a set of 3 nested functions, the last of which throws an error. Use one of the commands to show the call stack after the error is thrown.
